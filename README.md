## What this is
An easy to understand reference guide that will walk you through building an accessible website, component-by-component, using HyperText Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), and JavaScript(JS). These three languages are generally regarded as the "Front End" of the website and those who specialize in these languages are known as "Front End Developers", "User Experience Engineers", or "User Interface Engineers" but the specifics of the work might dip into an ever growing set of Content Management Systems (CMS's) and Frameworks.

## What this isn't
This is not a guide that will explain how to build a website using a JavaScript Framework such as Angular, React, or Vue or other related backend web languages. There is nothing wrong with guide that give a deep dive into those technologies, but this is meant to be as agnostic of a guide as possible giving a good foundation that will help you make better websites regardless of what technology you are working with.
