## Why I wrote this guide
Over the past 10 years I've built websites for a variety of industries from video games to one of highly regulated banks in the united states. The three technologies that have been consistent throughout all of those organizations is HyperText Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), and JavaScript(JS) -- These three languages are generally regarded as the "Front End" of the website and those who specialize in these languages are known as "Front End Developers", "User Experience Engineers", or "User Interface Engineers" but the specifics of the work might dip into an ever growing set of Content Management Systems (CMS's) and Frameworks.

In addition to those three languages, I have a series of development tips and tricks that I like to use and would love to document them in a place that other folks might get some use out of them.

## What this is
An easy to understand reference guide that will walk you through building an accessible website, component-by-component, using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## What this isn't
This is not a guide that will explain how to build a website using a JavaScript Framework such as Angular, React, or Vue or other related backend web languages. All of those languages solve specific problems and have their own unique sytaxes, but they all display HTML, CSS, and Javascript within the browser. This is meant to be as agnostic of a guide as possible giving a good foundation that will help you make better websites regardless of what technology you are working with.

## How this guide will be structured
This guide will assume that you are being handed a completely designed web page, and there will be helpful little asides like this for something that might not be relevant to our task but give you more insight into my professional life*
Aside: Whatever a designer hands you is never fully designed until it has been coded by a developer. It's hard the completely manage all of the rules that browsers use to render CSS within a design program such as AdobeXD, Sketch, or Figma so there should be a healthy back of forth between you and your designer depending on how things render within the browser and the designers vision.

Each page will then be broken down into the larger components that make up that page
