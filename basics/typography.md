# Typography

Quote about typography: "Make it easy to read." - Roger Black

Have you ever come across a website that was a little too hard to read? Could you put your finger on why it was a more challenging experience for you? Was the color of the font a little too light and was it set on a white background? Were the letters a little too close together? Did each line of text stretch across the screen and you had a hard time keeping your place as your eyes darted back and forth?

Typography consists of the style and appearance of all of the text on the screen (and printed material) and is one of the foundational assets of all websites. When done in an accessible and visually pleasing way, great typography helps to create great websites by making it easy to read and reducing eye strain for your readers.

In addition to that - well defined technical typography helps create a base system for your website that makes it easy to build the rest of your grids, components, and templates in a consistent manner.
