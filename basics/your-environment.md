# Your development environment

A development environment doesn't need to be anything fancy. You can get by with any simple text editor that you have on your computer to create an .html file and by dragging it into your browser will allow you to view your website!

## Building a webpage with a simple text editor

Let's take a look at how we will do that. First, open up the text editor that's already pre-installed on your computer. This could be TextEdit(Apple) or Notepad(Windows).

Create a new file called "my-first-website.html" and make sure that it is saved as a .html file and copy and paste the following HTML code:

<code type="HTML">
    <h1>My First Website</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage and Iâ€™m excited to learn more on my journey.</p>
</code>

Save the file and drag the file onto your favorite web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and you should see the brand new webpage that you have created!

This is by far the most simple way to create a website, but much like other tradeskills, having the right tools will help you to focus on your work and contribute to you building better websites!
